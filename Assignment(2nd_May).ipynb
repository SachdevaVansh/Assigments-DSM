    "\n",
    "Ans: Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify patterns or data points that deviate significantly from normal behavior. \n",

    "Q3. How does unsupervised anomaly detection differ from supervised anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Unsupervised anomaly detection relies on identifying anomalies in data without prior knowledge or labeled examples of anomalies. It discovers abnormal patterns based on the inherent structure of the data. Supervised anomaly detection, on the other hand, requires labeled examples of anomalies to train a model that can classify new instances as normal or abnormal.\n"
