    "Q1. Explain the concept of homogeneity and completeness in clustering evaluation. How are they calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Homogeneity and completeness are evaluation metrics for clustering. Homogeneity measures if all data points within a cluster belong to the same true class, while completeness measures if all data points of a true class are assigned to  the same cluster. They are calculated using formulas involving conditional entropy and entropy.\n",

For example, consider a clustering result where all data points of a single class are perfectly assigned to a cluster, but data points of other classes are scattered across different clusters. This would result in high homogeneity (within the single class) but low completeness (for the other classes).\n"
