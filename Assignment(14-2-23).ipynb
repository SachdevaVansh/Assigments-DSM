    "A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently or scheduled by the Operating System. In the computer system, an Operating System achieves multitasking by dividing the process into threads. A thread is a lightweight process that ensures the execution of the process separately on the system.\n",

    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",

    "* It is a very useful technique for time-saving and improving the performance of an application. Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks and simultaneously run them in a program. It allows threads to communicate and share resources such as files, data, and memory to the same processor. Furthermore, it increases the user's responsiveness to continue running a program even if a part of the application is the length or blocked.\n",

    "#### Advantages-\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improved performance and concurrency-\n",
    "For certain applications, performance and concurrency can be improved by using multithreading and multicontexting together. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplified coding of remote procedure calls and conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simultaneous access to multiple applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced number of required servers-\n",
    "Because one server can dispatch multiple service threads, the number of servers to start for your application is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages-\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty of writing code-\n",
    "Multithreaded and multicontexted applications are not easy to write. Only experienced programmers should undertake coding for these types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty of debugging-\n",
    "It is much harder to replicate an error in a multithreaded or multicontexted application than it is to do so in a single-threaded, single-contexted application. As a result, it is more difficult, in the former case, to identify and verify root causes when errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty of managing concurrency-\n",
    "The task of managing concurrency among threads is difficult and has the potential to introduce new problems into an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty of testing-\n",
    "Testing a multithreaded application is more difficult than testing a single-threaded application because defects are often timing-related and more difficult to reproduce."
