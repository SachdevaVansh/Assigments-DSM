    "Q1. What are the different types of clustering algorithms, and how do they differ in terms of their approach and underlying assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The different types of clustering algorithms include K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models. They differ in how they group data points together based on distance or density measures, and their assumptions about the shape, size, and number of clusters in the data."

    "Q2. What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans: K-means clustering is a simple algorithm for grouping data points into clusters. It works by randomly selecting cluster centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and updating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points until convergence is reached.\n"
